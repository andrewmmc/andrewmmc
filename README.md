### Hi, I'm Andrew.

Frontend development is my passion as a forward-thinking and motivated Software Engineer with over five years of expertise. I have rapidly developed UI components in collaboration with designers and rewrote multiple web applications for better performance and reduced maintenance costs. I enjoy creating beautiful, simple and elegant web applications. I always pay special attention to the details while maintaining a creative mindset.

My skills include TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), React, Node.js, PHP, and related technologies. Professional Scrum Master I certified.
